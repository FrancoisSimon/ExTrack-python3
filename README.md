ExTrack
-------

This repository contains the necessary scripts to run the method ExTrack. ExTrack is a method to detemine Kinetics of tracks able to transition between different motion states. It can assess diffusion coefficients transition rates, localization error as well as annotating the probability for any track to be in each state for every time points.

ExTrack has been designed and implemented by Fran√ßois Simon. The python implementation of ExTrack can profite from GPU parallelization using the cupy library. An additionnal version of ExTrack is available on Fiji via Trackmate thanks to Jean-Yves Tinevez https://sites.imagej.net/TrackMate-ExTrack/. The fiji version can profite from CPU parallelization better performances.

# Dependencies

- numpy
- lmfit
- xmltodict

Optional: jupyter, cupy

For GPU parallelization, cupy can be installed as described here : https://github.com/cupy/cupy. The cupy version will depend on your cuda version which itself must be compatible with your GPU driver and GPU. Usage of cupy requires a change in the extrack module : GPU_computing = False


# Installation (from pip)

`pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ ExTrack`

# Installation (from this Gitlab) repository

## Install dependencies
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Alternatively, you can install the dependencies manually by typing:
`pip install numpy lmfit`

Optional : `pip install jupyter`

## Install ExTrack

Simply run (as root): `python setup.py install`

Check that it worked: `python -c "import extrack"`

# Tutorial

**Document here how to open a Jupyter notebook**

# Usage
## Main functions

## Extra functions
The `writers` submodule contains some useful functions:

- `mat_to_csv(in_path, out_path)` converts a .mat file to a CSV. It can easily be scripted.

## Input file format
## Caveats
